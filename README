### What I learned

In this challenge, I began to use Flexbox a lot more and greatly expanded knowledge using it. I was able to center the NTF card with very minimal code. Then I found a html method of align an image/icon with text beside it using the align attribute. Next I learned to use the hover pseudo-class and directly insert an image into a css file.

````css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .main-image {
    width: 260px;
    height: 260px;
    margin: 20px 20px 0px 20px;
  }

  #cube-image {
    width: 260px;
    height: 260px;
    border-radius: 7.5px;
  }

  #cube-image:hover {
    opacity: 0.35;
  }

  .main-image:hover {
    background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.45);
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    background-size: 45px 45px;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    filter: brightness(1.5);
    background-image: url(images/icon-view.svg);
  }
}
```html
  <div class="main-icons">
    <div class="ethereum-icon">
      <h2>
        <img
          id="icon"
          src="images/icon-ethereum.svg"
          alt="ethereum-icon"
          align="left"
        />0.041 ETH
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="clock-icon">
      <h3>
        <img
          id="icon"
          src="images/icon-clock.svg"
          alt="clock-icon"
          align="left"
        />
        3 days left
      </h3>
    </div>
  </div>

### Continued development

/* I would like to grow my knowledge using images in css and the different properties that modify the images. I would also like to grow my knowledge of flexbox.*/
